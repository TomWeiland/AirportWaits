# AirportWaits
Analysis of Airport Security Waits.  
This repository contains Python code, R code, and outputs in a Jupyter Notebooks environment.  
The purpose is to analyze airport security wait times for trends and predictability.  
Part 1 covers data munging, data exploration, parametric curve fits, and parametric models.  
The Part 1 parametric models are built in a machine learning context.  
Alternative parametric models in Part 1 include OLS, regularized regression, and non-linear survival analysis techniques.
